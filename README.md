BrowTeco is your buddy who is always there to tell you where to find the best beer.

This app will make use of Slack and Api.ai, in order to create a smart bot that will help people find shops which sell good beers.

Feel free to contribute to this repo, as I am very interested in learning more about Slack's 'bots and A.I. using Swift.
